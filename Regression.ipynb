What is Simple Linear Regression?\n","  - Simple Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a straight line. It predicts the dependent variable (Y) based on the independent variable (X) using the equation:  \n","  **Y = mX + b**,  \n","  where **m** is the slope and **b** is the intercept. It's widely used for forecasting and understanding trends.\n","\n","\n","\n","2.  What are the key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression?\n","  - Simple Linear Regression relies on these key assumptions:  \n","  1. **Linearity** ‚Äì The relationship between X and Y is a straight line.  \n","  2. **Independence** ‚Äì Observations are independent of each other.  \n","  3. **Homoscedasticity** ‚Äì The variance of errors remains constant across all values of X.  \n","  4. **Normality** ‚Äì The residuals (errors) are normally distributed.  \n","  5. **No Multicollinearity** ‚Äì The independent variable is not highly correlated with another predictor.  \n","\n","  These ensure accurate predictions and valid results!\n","\n","\n","\n","3.  What does the coefficient m represent in the equation Y=mX+c?\n","  - In the equation **Y = mX + c**, the coefficient **m** represents the **slope** of the line. It indicates how much **Y** changes for a **unit increase** in **X**‚Äîessentially, the rate of change or the strength of the relationship between the two variables. A higher **m** means a steeper slope!\n","\n","\n","\n","4.  What does the intercept c represent in the equation Y=mX+c?\n","  - In the equation **Y = mX + c**, the intercept **c** represents the **starting value** of **Y** when **X = 0**. It indicates where the line crosses the **Y-axis** and helps define the baseline level of the dependent variable before any changes in **X** occur.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","5.  How do we calculate the slope m in Simple Linear Regression?\n","  - The slope m in Simple Linear Regression is calculated using the formula:\n","\n","    ùëö = (‚àë(ùëãi-X)(Yi-Y))/‚àë(Xi-X)^2\n","\n","\n","  where:\n","    - Xi and Yi are individual data points.\n","    - X and Y are the mean values of X and Y.\n","\n","  This measures how much Y changes per unit increase in X!\n","\n","\n","\n","6.  What is the purpose of the least squares method in Simple Linear Regression?\n","  - The **least squares method** in Simple Linear Regression is used to find the **best-fitting** line by minimizing the **sum of squared errors** (differences between actual and predicted values).

How is the coefficient of determination (R¬≤) interpreted in Simple Linear Regression?\n","  - The **coefficient of determination (R¬≤)** measures how well the regression line fits the data. It ranges from **0 to 1**, where:  \n","  - **R¬≤ = 1** means the model perfectly predicts the dependent variable.  \n","  - **R¬≤ = 0** means the independent variable explains none of the variation in Y.  \n","\n","  Higher **R¬≤** values indicate a **stronger correlation** and better predictive accuracy, while lower values suggest the model may not capture important relationships in the data.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","8.  What is Multiple Linear Regression?\n","  - **Multiple Linear Regression** extends Simple Linear Regression by predicting a dependent variable (**Y**) using **multiple** independent variables (**X‚ÇÅ, X‚ÇÇ, X‚ÇÉ,...**). The equation is:  \n","\n","  Y = b‚ÇÄ + b‚ÇÅX‚ÇÅ + b‚ÇÇX‚ÇÇ + ... + b‚ÇôX‚Çô\n","\n","\n","  where each **b** represents a coefficient showing the impact of an independent variable on **Y**. It helps model complex relationships and improves prediction accuracy.\n","\n","\n","\n","9. What is the main difference between Simple and Multiple Linear Regression?\n","  - The main difference is:  \n","  - **Simple Linear Regression** uses **one** independent variable to predict the dependent variable.  \n","  - **Multiple Linear Regression** uses **two or more** independent variables to improve prediction accuracy.  \n","\n","  Multiple Linear Regression models complex relationships by analyzing how multiple factors influence the outcome!\n","\n","\n","\n","10.

What are the limitations of using R¬≤ as a sole measure of model performance?\n","  - While **R¬≤** helps assess how well a regression model fits the data, it has several limitations if used alone:  \n","\n","  1. **Does not indicate causation** ‚Äì A high **R¬≤** does not mean X directly causes changes in Y.  \n","  2. **Ignores model complexity** ‚Äì It does not account for overfitting or unnecessary predictors.  \n","  3. **Can be misleading in non-linear relationships** ‚Äì May underestimate the fit for complex data.  \n","  4. **Sensitive to outliers** ‚Äì Extreme values can distort **R¬≤**, making it unreliable.  \n","  5. **Does not measure predictive accuracy** ‚Äì A high **R¬≤** does not guarantee good future predictions.  \n","\n","  To get a full picture, it's best to use **adjusted R¬≤, residual analysis, and other performance metrics** like RMSE or MAE!\n","\n","\n","\n","19.  How would you interpret a large standard error for a regression coefficient?\n","  - A **large standard error** for a regression coefficient indicates **high variability** in the estimated coefficient, meaning it is **less reliable**.  \n","\n","  Interpretation:  \n","  - **Weak predictor** ‚Äì The independent variable may have a **low impact** on the dependent variable.  \n","  - **High uncertainty** ‚Äì The coefficient‚Äôs true value may vary significantly across samples.  \n","  - **Potential multicollinearity** ‚Äì If predictors are highly correlated, it can inflate standard errors.  \n","  - **Small sample size** ‚Äì Fewer observations can lead to **unstable coefficient estimates**.  \n","\n","  To improve reliability, consider **adding more data, reducing multicollinearity, or adjusting the model!**\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","20.
