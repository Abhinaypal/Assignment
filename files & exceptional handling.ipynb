{"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0,"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[],"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyMMSGn1TB9Arr/nRQy/uXQR"},"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Theory Questions\n"],"metadata":{"id":"tgCG7GNHAJik"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1.  What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n","  - Interpreted languages execute code line by line through an interpreter, making them slower but more flexible (e.g., Python, JavaScript). Compiled languages convert the entire code into machine code before execution, resulting in faster performance but requiring compilation beforehand (e.g., C, C++).\n","\n","\n","2. What is exception handling in Python?\n","  - Exception handling in Python allows you to manage runtime errors gracefully. Using try, except, and optionally finally, you can catch and handle exceptions without crashing the program, ensuring smooth execution.\n","\n","\n","3.  What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n","  - The finally block in Python executes code regardless of whether an exception occurs, ensuring important cleanup actions, like closing files or releasing resources, are always performed.\n","\n","\n","4. What is logging in Python?\n","  - Logging in Python is a way to track events in your program by recording messages. Using the logging module, you can log messages of various severity levels (e.g., info, warning, error) to help debug and monitor your application's behavior.\n","\n","\n","\n","5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n","  - The __del__ method in Python is a special method called a destructor. It is triggered when an object is about to be destroyed, allowing you to define cleanup actions like releasing resources or closing connections before the object is deleted.\n","\n","\n","6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n","  - import loads the entire module, and you access its members using the module name (e.g., module.function()).\n","  - from ... import imports specific members (e.g., from module import function), allowing direct access without the module name.\n","\n","\n","\n","7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n","  - In Python, you can handle multiple exceptions by using multiple except blocks for specific exceptions or a single except block with a tuple of exceptions. For example:\n","\n","  try:\n","      // Code that might raise exceptions\n","  except (Exception1, Exception2):\n","      // Handle multiple exceptions together\n","  except Exception3:\n","      // Handle Exception3 separately\n","\n","\n","8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n","  - The with statement in Python ensures proper handling of resources like files. It automatically closes the file after the block of code is executed, even if exceptions occur, simplifying resource management and preventing resource leaks.\n","\n","\n","9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n","  - Multithreading: Runs multiple threads within the same process, sharing memory, which makes it lightweight but prone to race conditions. Suitable for I/O-bound tasks.  \n","  - Multiprocessing: Runs multiple processes, each with its own memory space, providing better parallelism but consuming more resources. Ideal for CPU-bound tasks.\n","\n","\n","10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n","  - Here are the advantages of using logging in a program:\n","\n","  1. Debugging and Troubleshooting: Logs help identify issues in code by recording errors and abnormal behavior.  \n","  2. Monitoring: Track program activity and performance in real time or over time.  \n","  3. Error Analysis: Detailed logs make it easier to analyze and fix unexpected issues.  \n","  4. Customizable: Logs can be categorized by severity (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) for better organization.  \n","  5. Persistence: Logging provides a record of events that can be stored and reviewed later, unlike print statements.  \n","  6. Minimal Impact: Logging can operate in the background without significantly affecting performance.  \n","\n","  A well-implemented logging system ensures smooth program maintenance and supports informed decisions!\n","\n","\n","11. What is memory management in Python?\n","  - Memory management in Python involves automatic allocation and deallocation of memory using its built-in garbage collector. It manages memory through object reference counting and removes unused objects to optimize resource usage, ensuring efficient program execution.\n","\n","\n","\n","12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n","  - The basic steps in Python's exception handling are:\n","\n","  1. Try Block: Enclose code that might raise exceptions using try.\n","  2. Except Block: Handle specific exceptions or catch all exceptions with except.\n","  3. Else Block: Execute code if no exceptions occur.\n","  4. Finally Block: Run cleanup code regardless of exceptions.\n","\n","  This structure ensures errors are managed gracefully and resources are properly handled.\n","\n","\n","13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n","  - Memory management is crucial in Python to ensure efficient use of resources, prevent memory leaks, and optimize program performance. It allows the system to handle memory allocation and deallocation seamlessly, enabling smooth execution of applications.\n","\n","\n","14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n","  - The try block is used to enclose code that might raise exceptions, while the except block catches and handles those exceptions, preventing the program from crashing and ensuring graceful error management.\n","\n","\n","15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n","  - Python's garbage collection system automatically manages memory by removing unused or unreachable objects. It primarily uses reference counting, where each object tracks how many references point to it. When the reference count drops to zero, the object is deallocated. To handle circular references (e.g., objects referencing each other), Python's garbage collector employs a cyclic garbage collection algorithm, detecting and clearing such cycles to free up memory efficiently. This ensures smooth resource management during program execution.\n","\n","\n","16.  What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n","  - The else block in exception handling executes code only if no exceptions occur in the try block. It is used to separate successful code from error-handling logic, improving clarity.\n","\n","\n","17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n","  - The common logging levels in Python are:\n","\n","  1. DEBUG: Detailed information for diagnosing problems.  \n","  2. INFO: General information about program execution.  \n","  3. WARNING: Indicates potential issues but allows the program to continue.  \n","  4. ERROR: Reports errors that prevent a part of the program from functioning.  \n","  5. CRITICAL: Serious errors causing the program to crash or requiring immediate attention.  \n","\n","  These levels help categorize and manage log messages effectively.\n","\n","\n","18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n","  - os.fork(): Creates a new child process by duplicating the current process. It's lower-level, available only on Unix-based systems, and requires manual management of process communication.  \n","  - Multiprocessing: A Python module that provides a higher-level interface for creating and managing processes, including easier inter-process communication and compatibility across platforms (Windows, Unix).\n","\n","\n","\n","19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n","  - Closing a file in Python ensures that all changes are saved and resources like memory or file handles are released. It prevents data corruption, resource leaks, and issues when accessing the file later.\n","\n","\n","20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n","  - file.read(): Reads the entire file or a specified number of characters as a single string.  \n","  - file.readline(): Reads only one line from the file at a time, making it more memory-efficient for large files.\n","\n","\n","21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n","  - The logging module in Python is used to record messages about a program's execution, such as errors, warnings, or general information. It helps in debugging, monitoring, and maintaining applications efficiently by providing customizable log levels and output formats.\n","\n","\n","22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n","  - The os module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system, enabling tasks like file creation, deletion, renaming, and accessing file properties, as well as navigating directories for efficient file handling.\n","\n","\n","23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n","  - The challenges in Python's memory management include:\n","\n","  1. Garbage Collection Overhead: Automatic garbage collection may introduce performance lags during cleanup.  \n","  2. Circular References: Handling objects that reference each other can complicate memory management.  \n","  3. High Memory Usage: Dynamic typing and object creation may lead to increased memory consumption.  \n","  4. Manual Optimization: Developers might need to optimize memory use in large-scale or performance-critical applications.  \n","\n","  Efficient memory management often requires balancing Pythonâ€™s flexibility with resource-conscious programming.\n","\n","\n","24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n","  - You can raise an exception manually in Python using the raise keyword, followed by the exception type. For example:\n","\n","  raise ValueError(\"Custom error message\")\n","\n","\n","  This interrupts the program flow and triggers the specified exception.\n","\n","\n","25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n","  - Multithreading is important in applications to improve efficiency by allowing multiple threads to execute concurrently. It is particularly useful for I/O-bound tasks, as it reduces idle time and enhances performance by enabling simultaneous operations."],"metadata":{"id":"0aemLxxtAOSr"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Practical Questions\n"],"metadata":{"id":"U6QERqvlAqYG"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"id":"Bn9lJaBx_R7E","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1742264561815,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":43,"user":{"displayName":"Pal Abhinay","userId":"05867957985366816427"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# 1.
