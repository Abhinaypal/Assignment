What is Python, and why is it popular?\n","\n"," - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility.\n"," - Its popularity stems from its ease of use, extensive libraries, and strong community support, making it suitable for various applications like web development, data science, and automation.\n","\n","2.  What is an interpreter in Python?\n"," - A Python interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line, translating it into machine instructions in real-time. This allows for dynamic execution without prior compilation.\n","\n","\n","3. What are pre-defined keywords in python?\n"," - Pre-defined keywords in python reserved words with special meanings that cannot be used as variable. Here are some keywords -->\n","\n","false\n","True\n","None\n","if\n","elif\n","else\n","print\n","def\n","del\n","break\n","continue\n","class\n","for\n","while\n","etc.\n","\n","4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n"," - No.\n","\n","5. What is mutability in Python?\n"," - Mutability in Python refers to whether an object can be changed after it is created.\n","\n","Mutable objects can be modified, such as lists, dictionaries, and sets. Immutable objects cannot be modified, such as strings, tuples, and integers.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","my_list = [1, 2, 3] #mutable\n","\n","my_list[0] = 10 #List can be changed\n","\n","my_string = \"hello\" #immutable\n","\n","my_string[0] = 'H'\n","      #Error, string is immutable\n","\n","6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n"," - **Lists are Mutable**: Lists are designed to be flexible and can be modified after creation. You can add, remove, or change elements in a list. Lists are commonly used when you need to maintain and modify a collection of items over time. This mutability allows lists to be used for tasks where the collection of items will change, such as adding or removing elements, sorting, or updating data.\n","\n","  Example --> my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n","\n","  my_list[0] = 10  #Changing the first element\n","\n","  my_list.append(4)  #Adding an element at the end\n","\n","  print(my_list)  #Output: [10, 2, 3, 4]\n","\n"," - **Tuple are Immutable**: Tuples are designed to be fixed and unchangeable once created. Once you assign values to a tuple, you cannot alter, add, or remove its elements. Tuples are used when you want to create a collection of values that should not be changed during the program's execution (e.g., representing a fixed set of data). The immutability ensures the integrity of the data, making it safe to use in situations where the data should not change, such as dictionary keys or data that should remain constant.\n","\n","  Example --> my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n","\n","\n","7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n"," -(==) checks if the values are the same, while (is) checks if they are the same object in memory.\n","  #== check both values are same or not\n","  a = [1, 2, 3]\n","  b = [1, 2, 3]\n","  print(a == b)  \n","  #Output: True\n","\n","\n","  #is check memory locations are same or not\n","  a = [1, 2, 3]\n","  b = a\n","  print(a is b)  \n","  #Output: True\n","\n","\n","8. What are logical operators in Python?\n"," - Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements. The main ones are:\n","\n","   - (and) Returns True if both statements are true.\n","      a = True\n","      b = False\n","      print(a and b)\n","       #Output: False\n","\n","   -  (or) Returns True if at least one statement is true.\n","\n","      a = True\n","      b = False\n","      print(a or b)\n","       #Output: True\n","\n","    - (not) Reverses the result.\n","\n","      a = True\n","      print(not a)\n","       #Output: False\n","\n","\n","9. What is typecasting in python?\n"," - Typecasting in Python is the process of converting one data type to another. It allows you to change the type of a variable, so you can perform operations that require specific data types.\n","\n"," Example:\n","      #Convert a string to an integer\n","      a = \"123\"\n","      b = int(a)\n","      print(b)  # Output: 123 (as an integer)\n","\n","In this example, the string \"123\" is typecast to the integer 123.\n","\n","\n","10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n"," - **Implicit Type Casting**: Python automatically converts one data type to another. This happens without any user intervention.\n","\n","  a = 5\n","  b = 2.5\n","  c = a + b  #int(a) is automatically converted to float\n","  print(c)  \n","  #Output: 7.5\n","\n","  - **Explicit Type Casting**: The user manually converts one data type to another using functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.\n","  \n","  a = \"10\"\n","  b = int(a)  #converting string to int\n","  print(b)  \n","  #Output: 10 (as an int)\n","\n","\n","11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?\n"," - Conditional statements in Python are used to make decisions based on certain conditions. They allow the code to execute different actions depending on whether a condition is true or false.\n","\n","  a = 10\n","  if a>5:\n","      print(\"a is greater than 5\")\n","  else:\n","      print(\"a is less than 5\")\n","\n","\n","12. How does the elif statement work ?\n"," - The elif statement in Python stands for \"else if\" and is used to check multiple conditions sequentially. It's part of the conditional control flow, where you want to execute different blocks of code depending on various conditions.\n","\n","  a = 10\n","  if a > 5:\n","      print(\"a is greater than 5\")\n","  elif a == 10:\n","      print(\"a is equal to 10\")\n","  else:\n","      print(\"a is less than 5\")\n","\n","13. What is the difference between for and while loops ?\n"," - **For Loop**: Used when you know the number of iterations in advance. It iterates over a sequence like a list, tuple, or string or a range of numbers.\n","\n","  for i in range(5):\n","      print(i)\n","\n","  - **While Loop**: Used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand. It continues to execute as long as a specified condition is true.\n","\n","  i = 0\n","  while i>5:\n","      print(i)\n","      i += 1\n","\n","\n","14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n"," - Imagine you're developing a simple number guessing game where the player has to guess a random number between 1 and 100. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.\n","\n","Here's why a while loop is more suitable:\n","\n","Uncertain Iterations: You don't know how many guesses the player will need. The loop should run until the correct number is guessed.\n","\n","      import random\n","\n","      target = random.randint(1, 100)\n","      guess = None\n","\n","      while guess != target:\n","          guess = int(input(\"Guess the number: \"))\n","          if guess < target:\n","              print(\"Too low!\")\n","          elif guess > target:\n","              print(\"Too high!\")\n","\n","      print(\"Congratulations! You've guessed the right number.\")\n","\n","  - In this scenario, a while loop works perfectly because it continues to prompt the player until the correct number is guessed, regardless of how many attempts it takes. Using a for loop wouldn't be as effective because the number of iterations is not predetermined."],"metadata":{"id":"6dln0sNH1L-z"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Practical Questions"],"metadata":{"id":"Gs8tV8b8AYp_"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 1.
