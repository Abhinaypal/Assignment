What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).\n","  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects,\" which can contain data (attributes) and code (methods). It emphasizes principles like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction to build reusable, modular, and efficient software.\n","\n","\n","2. What is a class in OOP?\n","  - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have. Essentially, it's a way to organize and structure code by grouping related data and functionality together.\n","\n","\n","3. What is an object in OOP?\n","  - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is an instance of a class. It is a tangible representation of the class blueprint, containing specific values for the attributes (data) and being able to perform actions using its methods (functions). Objects are the building blocks of OOP and enable real-world problem modeling.\n","\n","\n","4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n","  - Abstraction and encapsulation are fundamental concepts in OOP, but they focus on different aspects:\n","\n","  - **Abstraction**: Focuses on *hiding complexity* by showing only the essential features of an object while omitting unnecessary details. It helps in defining a clear interface for interaction. Example: A car's driver only interacts with the steering wheel, ignoring the internal engine mechanics.\n","\n","  - **Encapsulation**: Focuses on *hiding the internal data* of an object and restricting access to it by exposing only certain methods. It ensures data security and integrity. Example: Variables of a class can be made private and accessed or modified using public methods (getters/setters).\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n","  - Dunder methods (short for \"double underscore\" methods), also known as magic methods or special methods, are predefined methods in Python that have names surrounded by double underscores, like __init__, __str__, or __add__. These methods allow you to define how objects of your class behave in specific situations, such as when they're instantiated, printed, or used in operations.\n","\n","  - For example:\n","  - __init__: Initializes an object's attributes (constructor).\n","  - __str__: Defines how an object is represented as a string.\n","  - __add__: Enables custom behavior for the + operator.\n","\n","  - Dunder methods make classes more versatile and integrate smoothly with Python's built-in features!\n","\n","\n","6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n","  -Inheritance in OOP allows a **child class** to inherit attributes and methods from a **parent class**, enabling code reuse and hierarchy. The child can also override or extend the parent's functionality.\n","\n","  class Vehicle:  // Parent class\n","    def move(self):\n","        print(\"This vehicle can move.\")\n","\n","  class Car(Vehicle):  // Child class inheriting from Vehicle\n","    def move(self):  // Overriding the parent method\n","        print(\"This car drives on roads.\")\n","\n","  car = Car()\n","  car.move()  // Output: This car drives on roads.\n","\n","\n","7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n","  - Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the ability of objects to take on multiple forms. It allows the same method name to perform different functions based on the object it is called on, enabling flexibility and code reuse.\n","\n","  **Example in Python**:\n","\n","  class Bird:\n","    def speak(self):\n","        print(\"The bird chirps.\")\n","\n","  class Dog:\n","    def speak(self):\n","        print(\"The dog barks.\")\n","\n","  // Polymorphism in action\n","  for animal in [Bird(), Dog()]:\n","    animal.speak()\n","\n","  - Here, the speak() method behaves differently depending on whether it’s called on a Bird or a Dog object. This is polymorphism at work!\n","\n","\n","8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n","  - Encapsulation in Python is achieved by restricting direct access to an object's data and providing controlled access through methods. This is done by:\n","\n","  1. **Using access specifiers**:\n","    - **Public**: Attributes/methods accessible everywhere (default in Python).\n","    - **Protected**: Prefix the attribute name with _ (e.g., _variable). It's a convention indicating it should not be accessed directly outside the class.\n","    - **Private**: Prefix the attribute name with __ (e.g., __variable), making it inaccessible outside the class.\n","\n","  2. **Providing getters and setters**:\n","    - These methods allow controlled access to private/protected attributes.\n","\n","\n","  class Person:\n","      def __init__(self, name, age):\n","          self.__name = name  \n","          self.__age = age\n","\n","      // Getter for name\n","      def get_name(self):\n","          return self.__name\n","\n","      // Setter for name\n","      def set_name(self, name):\n","          self.__name = name\n","\n","\n","  person = Person(\"Alice\", 25)\n","  print(person.get_name())  // Accessing private attribute via getter\n","  person.set_name(\"Bob\")    // Modifying private attribute via setter\n","\n","\n","  This ensures that data integrity and security are maintained!\n","\n","\n","9. What is a constructor in Python?\n","  - In Python, a constructor is a special method, __init__(), used to initialize an object’s attributes when it is created. It is automatically called when an object is instantiated from a class.\n","\n","\n","10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n","  - - **Class Methods**: Defined with @classmethod. Use cls as the first parameter. They can access/modify class-level data but not instance data.\n","\n","  - **Static Methods**: Defined with @staticmethod. No self or cls parameter. Used for utility functions without accessing class or instance data.\n","\n","\n","11. What is method overloading in Python?\n","  - Method overloading in Python refers to defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or counts. However, Python does not natively support method overloading; instead, it can be simulated using default arguments or variable-length arguments.\n","\n","  **Example**:\n","\n","  class Example:\n","      def display(self, a=None, b=None):\n","          if a and b:\n","              print(f\"Two arguments: {a}, {b}\")\n","          elif a:\n","              print(f\"One argument: {a}\")\n","          else:\n","              print(\"No arguments\")\n","\n","  This approach adjusts behavior based on the number of arguments passed.\n","\n","\n","12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n","  - Method overriding in OOP occurs when a child class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. This allows the child class to customize or replace the inherited behavior.\n","\n","\n","13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n","  - The property decorator in Python is used to define a method as a property, allowing it to be accessed like an attribute while encapsulating getter, setter, and deleter functionality. It promotes clean and readable code.\n","\n","  **Example**:\n","  class Example:\n","      def __init__(self, value):\n","          self._value = value\n","\n","      @property\n","      def value(self):\n","          return self._value\n","\n","      @value.setter\n","      def value(self, new_value):\n","          self._value = new_value\n","\n","\n","  Here, value can be accessed like an attribute, but with the benefits of encapsulation.\n","\n","\n","14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n","  - Polymorphism is important in OOP because it enhances flexibility and reusability by allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This enables consistent method calls and simplifies code management.\n","\n","\n","\n","15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n","  - An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It serves as a blueprint for other classes and is defined using the ABC module. Abstract classes can include abstract methods (declared with abstractmethod) that must be implemented by subclasses.\n","\n","\n","\n","16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n","  - Here are few advantages of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python:\n","\n","  1. Code Reusability: Promotes reuse through inheritance, reducing duplication and effort.\n","  2. Modularity: Encourages organized code by bundling data and methods into classes, making programs easier to manage.\n","  3. Flexibility: Offers polymorphism for consistent interfaces, enhancing flexibility and scalability.\n","  4. Data Security: Ensures data protection through encapsulation, restricting direct access to sensitive attributes.\n","\n","\n","17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n","  -  Class Variable: Shared across all instances of a class. Defined at the class level and changes affect all instances.  \n","  - Instance Variable: Specific to each instance of a class. Defined within methods like __init__ and changes affect only that instance.\n","\n","\n","18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n","  - Multiple inheritance in Python allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class, enabling it to combine attributes and methods from all parent classes.\n","\n","\n","  class A:\n","      def method_a(self):\n","          print(\"Method from class A\")\n","\n","  class B:\n","      def method_b(self):\n","          print(\"Method from class B\")\n","\n","  class C(A, B):  // Inherits from both A and B\n","      pass\n","\n","  obj = C()\n","  obj.method_a()  // Output: Method from class A\n","  obj.method_b()  // Output: Method from class B\n","  \n","\n","  This shows how multiple inheritance brings together functionality from multiple sources!\n","\n","\n","19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n","  - In Python, the __str__ and __repr__ methods are special methods used to provide string representations of objects, but they serve different purposes:\n","\n","  1. __str__:\n","    - Purpose: Defines the \"informal\" or user-friendly string representation of an object.\n","    - Usage: Called when print() or str() is used on an object.\n","    - Example:\n","      class Example:\n","          def __str__(self):\n","              return \"This is a user-friendly string.\"\n","\n","      obj = Example()\n","      print(obj)  # Output: This is a user-friendly string.\n","\n","  2. __repr__:\n","    - Purpose: Defines the \"official\" or developer-oriented string representation of an object.\n","    - Usage: Called when repr() is used or in interactive sessions. It should ideally return a string that can recreate the object.\n","    - Example:\n","      class Example:\n","          def __repr__(self):\n","              return \"Example()\"\n","\n","      obj = Example()\n","      print(repr(obj))  # Output: Example()\n","\n","\n","\n","20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n","  - The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent class. It allows a child class to access and initialize the parent class's methods or properties, enabling code reuse and simplifying multiple inheritance scenarios.\n","\n","\n","21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n","  - The __del__ method in Python is a special method, also known as a destructor, that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It allows you to define cleanup actions, such as releasing resources or closing files, before the object is removed from memory.\n","\n","\n","22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n","  - @staticmethod: Does not take self or cls as a parameter. It’s a utility function that doesn’t access class or instance data and is tied to the class.\n","\n","  - @classmethod: Takes cls as the first parameter, allowing access or modification of class-level data. It operates on the class itself, not instances.\n","\n","\n","23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n","  - In Python, polymorphism with inheritance allows methods in the parent class to be overridden by the child class, enabling objects of different classes to be treated uniformly. This ensures dynamic and flexible method behavior based on the object's class.\n","\n","  class Parent:\n","      def greet(self):\n","          print(\"Hello from Parent!\")\n","\n","  class Child(Parent):\n","      def greet(self):\n","          print(\"Hello from Child!\")\n","\n","  obj = Child()\n","  obj.greet()  // Output: Hello from Child!\n","\n","  The greet method behaves differently depending on the object's class.\n","\n","\n","24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n","  - Method chaining in Python OOP is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single statement. Each method returns self, enabling the next method in the chain to execute.\n","\n","  class Example:\n","    def method1(self):\n","        print(\"Method 1\")\n","        return self\n","\n","    def method2(self):\n","        print(\"Method 2\")\n","        return self\n","\n","  Usage\n","  obj = Example()\n","  obj.method1().method2()\n","\n","  output :  Method 1\n","            Method 2\n","\n","\n","25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n","  - The __call__ method in Python allows an object of a class to be used like a function. When you \"call\" an instance, the __call__ method is executed.\n","\n","  class Example:\n","      def __call__(self, x):\n","          return x * x\n","\n","  obj = Example()\n","  print(obj(5))   Output: 25\n","\n","  Here, the object acts as a callable, simplifying the interface."],"metadata":{"id":"-nQ1RynKgqMB"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Practical Questions"],"metadata":{"id":"gXoo49-dtO7W"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"bvhX18GlgYOt","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1742191662700,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":20,"user":{"displayName":"Pal Abhinay","userId":"05867957985366816427"}},"outputId":"8aa67e8a-b5da-4f2f-d981-b6dbfb3e60b5"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Generic animal sound\n","Bark!\n"]}],"source":["# 1. .
