What is a RESTful API?\n","  - A RESTful API is a web service that follows REST principles, enabling communication between systems using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Resources are identified by unique URLs, and data is exchanged in formats like JSON. RESTful APIs are stateless and scalable.\n","\n","\n","\n","2.  Explain the concept of API specification.\n","  - An API specification is a detailed blueprint that outlines how an API functions and how developers can interact with it. It defines the endpoints, request methods (like GET, POST), parameters, authentication requirements, data formats (e.g., JSON or XML), and expected responses.\n","\n","  - Think of it as a contract between the API provider and the client, ensuring they can communicate seamlessly. Standards like OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) are commonly used to create such specifications.\n","\n","\n","\n","3.  What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n","  - Flask is a lightweight, flexible web framework for Python. It provides the tools and features needed to build web applications and APIs without unnecessary complexity. Flask is often described as a \"micro-framework\" because it doesn't require extensive setup or dependencies, allowing developers to start small and scale up as needed.\n","\n","  1. **Simplicity**: Flask is easy to learn and use, making it great for beginners and small projects.\n","  2. **Flexibility**: It provides the freedom to choose your tools, libraries, and structure.\n","  3. **Built-in Development Server**: Flask includes a built-in server, making it easy to test APIs during development.\n","  4. **Extensibility**: It supports various extensions for features like authentication, database integration, and more.\n","  5. **RESTful API Support**: Flask is particularly well-suited for creating RESTful APIs due to its route handling and response customization.\n","  6. **Community Support**: A large, active community and extensive documentation make problem-solving easier.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","4.  What is routing in Flask?\n","  - Routing in Flask maps URLs to functions. Use the @app.route() decorator to define routes, handle dynamic URLs, and support HTTP methods like GET and POST.\n","\n","  @app.route('/')\n","  def home():\n","    return \"Hello\"\n","\n","\n","\n","5.  How do you create a simple Flask application?\n","  - Creating a simple Flask application involves just a few steps. Here's how:\n","  install flask:\n","\n","  pip install flask\n","\n","  Create a python file: save a file named, for example, app.py.\n","\n","  Write Basic Code:\n","\n","  from flask import Flask\n","  app = Flask(__name__)\n","  @app.route('/')\n","  def home():\n","    return \"Welcome to flask\"\n","\n","  if __name__ == '__main__':\n","    app.run(debug=True)\n","\n","\n","  run your application: in terminal\n","  python app.py\n","\n","\n","  View in Browser: open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to see app.\n","\n","\n","  This app displays \"Welcome to flask\" on the homepage, its the foundation to build more advanced features like additional routes or templates.\n","\n","\n","\n","6.  What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?\n","  - RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform actions on resources. The main methods are:\n","\n","  GET: Retrieves data from the server (e.g., fetch a list of users).\n","\n","  POST: Creates new resources (e.g., add a new user).\n","\n","  PUT: Updates an existing resource entirely (e.g., update user details).\n","\n","  PATCH: Partially updates a resource (e.g., change a user's email only).\n","\n","  DELETE: Removes a resource (e.g., delete a user account).\n","\n","  OPTIONS: Describes the communication options for a resource.\n","\n","  HEAD: Fetches headers for a resource without the body (used to check metadata).\n","\n","  These methods ensure uniformity and clarity when interacting with RESTful APIs.\n","\n","\n","\n","7.  What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?\n","  - The @app.route decorator in flask is used to define routes, which map specific URLs to corresponding functionc in your application. Essentially, it tells flask which function should handle a given URL.\n","\n","  PURPOSE:\n","  1. URL Mapping: it binds a URL (like /) to a specific function.\n","  2. Dynamic Routing: it supports dynamic URLs with parameters, such as /user/<username>.\n","  3. HTTP Method Handling: you can specify HTTP methods ( GET, POST ) for each route.\n","\n","  @pp.route('/')\n","  def home():\n","    return \"Welcome\"\n","\n","  @app.route('/user/<username>')\n","  def greet(username):\n","    return f\"Hello, {username}\"\n","\n","\n","  in this example, visiting / displays \"Welcome\", and /user/abhinay greets the user \"abhinay\".\n","\n","\n","8.  What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?\n","  - **GET**: Retrieves data, sends information in the URL, can be cached/bookmarked, and is less secure.\n","\n","  - **POST**: Sends data to the server (e.g., forms), keeps data hidden in the request body, is more secure, and modifies resources.  \n","\n","  GET is for fetching data; POST is for creating or updating.\n","\n","\n","\n","9.  How do you handle errors in Flask APIs?\n","  - Handling errors in flask apls involves providing clear error responses to users while maintaining proper debugging practices.\n","  1. Use http status codes: Return appropriate status codes for errors( 404 for not found, 400 for bad request).\n","\n","  @app.route('/example')\n","  def example():\n","    return {\"error\": \"Resource not found\"}, 404\n","\n","  2. Flask's abort() function: Use abort() to generate standard HTTP error responses.\n","\n","  from flask import abort\n","  @app.route('/secure')\n","  def secure():\n","    abort(403) #forbidden\n","\n","\n","  3. Error Handlers: Define custom error handlers for specific status codes.\n","\n","  @app.errorhandler(404)\n","  def not_found(error):\n","    return {\"error\": \"page not found\"}, 404\n","\n","  4. Validation: validate user inputs to prevent errors from occuring due to invalid data.\n","  5. Debugging: During developement, enable debug=True in app.run() to see detailed error messages.\n","\n","\n","\n","10.  How do you connect Flask to a SQL database?\n","  - To connect flask to a sql database, you typically use an ORM (object-relational mapping) like sqlalchemy or a database connector. Here's how to do it with flask and sqlalchemy:\n","\n","  1. install dependencies:\n","  pip install flask sqlalchemy flask-sqlalchemy\n","\n","  2. configure your database: set up the database url in your flask app.\n","  app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite://mydatabase.db'\n","  app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False\n","\n","\n","  3. Initialize SQLAlchemy: create a database instance and models:\n","  from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy\n","\n","  db = SQLAlchemy(app)\n","\n","  class User(db.Model):\n","    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n","    name = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)\n","\n","  db.create_all()\n","\n","\n","  4. Perform database operations: Use SQLAlchemy commands to interact with the database:\n","\n","  new_user = User(name=\"Abhinay\")\n","  db.session.add(new_user)\n","  db.session.commit()\n","\n","\n","  This connects flask to the database, lets you define models, and allows CRUD operations.\n","\n","\n","\n","11.  What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy?\n","  - Flask-SQLAlchemy simplifies database management in Flask apps. It integrates SQLAlchemy, allowing you to define models, handle queries, manage sessions, and streamline database interactions efficiently.\n","\n","\n","\n","12.  What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful?\n","  - Flask Blueprints are a way to structure and organize a Flask application into smaller, modular components. They allow you to group routes, templates, static files, and other application features into separate modules while still working as part of the main app.\n","\n","  Why are Blueprints Useful?\n","  1. Code Organization: They help keep your codebase clean and modular by dividing large applications into manageable sections.\n","  2. Reusability: Blueprints can be reused across multiple applications or projects.\n","  3. Scalability: Ideal for large applications as they allow independent developement of features or components.\n","\n","  4. Simplified collaboration: teams can work on separate blueprints without conflicts.\n","\n","\n","\n","13.  What is the purpose of Flask's request object?\n","  - Flask's `request` object provides access to data sent by the client in HTTP requests, such as form data, JSON payloads, query parameters, headers, and cookies. It helps handle incoming data and user inputs effectively within your application.\n","\n","\n","\n","14.  How do you create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask?\n","  - To create a RESTful API enpoint in flask:\n","  1. install flask:\n","\n","  pip install flask\n","\n","  2. Write code:\n","\n","  from flask import flask, jsonify\n","\n","  app = Flask(__name__)\n","\n","  @app.route('/api/resource', methods=['GET'])\n","  def get_resource():\n","    return jsonify({\"message\": \"This is a RESTful API endpoint\"})\n","\n","  if __name__ == '__main__':\n","    app.run(debug=True)\n","\n","\n","  3. Run the app: Execute python app.py and access /api/resource on your browser or API client.\n","\n","\n","\n","15.  What is the purpose of Flask's jsonify() function?\n","  - Flask's `jsonify()` function converts Python dictionaries or lists into JSON format and sets the appropriate `Content-Type` header for the response. It simplifies sending JSON responses in APIs.\n","\n","\n","16.  Explain Flask’s url_for() function.\n","  - flask's url_for() function is used to dynamically build URLs for routes defined in your application. instead of hardcoding URLs, url_for() generates them based on the name of the view function and any arguments passed to it.\n","\n","  Purpose:\n","  1. Dynamic URL Generation: if routed or parameters change, url_for() automatically adjusts.\n","\n","  2. Ease of Maintenance: Reduces the rist of errors compared to hardcoding URLs.\n","\n","  3. Parameter Passing: Allows passing arguments for dynamic routes.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","17.  How does Flask handle static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)?\n","  - Flask handles static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images through a folder named static in the project's directory. By default, Flask serves files in this folder automatically.\n","\n","  Key Points:\n","  Static Folder: Place all static files inside the static directory, e.g., static/style.css.\n","\n","  Accessing Files: Reference static files in templates using url_for():\n","  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{{ url_for('static', filename='style.css') }}\">\n","\n","  Default URL: Static files are served at /static/filename.\n","\n","\n","18.  What is an API specification, and how does it help in building a Flask API?\n","  - An API specification is a detailed blueprint that outlines the functionality and structure of an API. It includes information such as endpoints, HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST), request and response formats, authentication requirements, and error handling.\n","\n","  1. **Standardization**: Ensures consistency across endpoints and makes the API easier to use.\n","  2. **Collaboration**: Developers and teams can work efficiently with a shared understanding of the API's structure.\n","  3. **Automation**: Tools like OpenAPI generate documentation and code based on the specification.\n","  4. **Ease of Development**: Acts as a guide during the implementation process, reducing errors and confusion.\n","\n","  It's like having a roadmap for designing and building the API effectively.\n","\n","\n","\n","19.  What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API?\n","  - HTTP status codes indicate the result of an HTTP request. They help Flask APIs communicate the outcome of requests, such as success (`200 OK`), resource creation (`201 Created`), client errors (`400 Bad Request`), or server errors (`500 Internal Server Error`). These codes ensure clear communication between the client and server.\n","\n","\n","\n","20.  How do you handle POST requests in Flask?\n","  - Handling POST requests in Flask involves receiving data sent by the client (e.g., a form submission) and processing it. Here's how you can do it:\n","\n","  1. **Define a Route with POST Method**:\n","   \n","   from flask import Flask, request\n","\n","   app = Flask(__name__)\n","\n","   @app.route('/submit', methods=['POST'])\n","   def submit():\n","       data = request.json  # Or use request.form for form data\n","       return {\"message\": f\"Received data: {data}\"}, 200\n","   \n","\n","  2. **Access Data**: Use `request.json` for JSON payloads or `request.form` for form data.\n","\n","  3. **Run the App**: Start the server with `python app.py` and send a POST request to `/submit`.\n","\n","  \n","\n","\n","21.  How would you secure a Flask API?\n","  - To secure a Flask API:\n","\n","    1. **Authentication**: Use tokens like JWT or OAuth2 for user authentication.\n","    2. **Validation**: Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks.\n","    3. **HTTPS**: Enforce secure connections to encrypt data in transit.\n","    4. **Rate Limiting**: Limit API requests to prevent abuse.\n","    5. **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing sensitive details in error messages.\n","    6. **CORS**: Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) properly.\n","    7. **Environment Variables**: Store secrets like API keys securely using `.env`.\n","\n","    These practices ensure robust API protection!\n","\n","\n","\n","22.  What is the significance of the Flask-RESTful extension?\n","  - Flask-RESTful simplifies building RESTful APIs in Flask. It provides tools like resource routing, request parsing, and automatic error handling, streamlining API development and ensuring cleaner, more maintainable code.\n","\n","\n","\n","23.  What is the role of Flask’s session object?\n","  - Flask's `session` object is used to store data on a per-user basis during their interaction with your application. It securely stores session data in cookies and allows you to track user-specific information across multiple requests.\n","\n","  1. **Data Persistence**: It retains user data between requests, such as login status or preferences.\n","  2. **Security**: Flask encrypts session data using a secret key, ensuring it’s safe from tampering.\n","  3. **Simplified Access**: Access session data like a dictionary (`session['key'] = value`).\n","\n","  This makes user-specific data management easy and efficient!"],"metadata":{"id":"IMKkCDZHUV2f"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Practical questions"],"metadata":{"id":"03kKycBJuLnT"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":106},"id":"hf0wcyd_UJg2","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1743399806163,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":751,"user":{"displayName":"Pal Abhinay","userId":"05867957985366816427"}},"outputId":"503a5783-1991-481e-b2d2-8f0f3887dce6"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"SyntaxError","evalue":"invalid syntax (<ipython-input-1-b35154b9b65f>, line 2)","traceback":["\u001b[0;36m  File \u001b[0;32m\"<ipython-input-1-b35154b9b65f>\"\u001b[0;36m, line \u001b[0;32m2\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;31m    pip install flask\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m        ^\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;31mSyntaxError\u001b[0m\u001b[0;31m:\u001b[0m invalid syntax\n"]}],"source":["# 1.
